This project is a fork from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator.

It contains files copied from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator. Some files may be copied and modified from there.

Following are the main changes this project adds on top of the original spark-on-k8s-operator project:

1. Add an API Gateway (REST Service) to accept Spark application submission and other operations.

2. Add a command line tool to submit Spark application to the API Gateway and do other related operations.
